# SwiftyGROQ

A typesafe declarative syntax for making swifty GROQ queries.

## About
GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) is an open source query language created and maintained by [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io). GROQ allows you to filter, sort, paginate and specify which data you want to mention just a subset of its features. You can learn more about GROQ [here](https://www.sanity.io/docs/how-queries-work).

### Motivation

If you use a GROQ enabled database for your Apple platform app, performing queries require you to store the queries as a string in your codebase. This has the following disadvantages:  

- Harder to read and understand the query
- Using variables in the query may require you to use string interpolation
- Queries are stored in plaintext in your app‚Äôs binary
- Not validated at compile time
- Has a special syntax you need to learn before using it

SwiftyGROQ attempts to solve many of these limitations by giving you a declarative and typesafe syntax.

In short, a query like this:  
![GROQ as a string](Resources/GROQString.png)  

Can be written like this:  
![GROQ as a string](Resources/GROQuery.png)

## Installation

To use this package in a SwiftPM project, you need to set it up as a package dependency:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.7
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyPackage",
  dependencies: [
    .package(
      url: "https://github.com/Eskils/SwiftyGROQ.git", 
      .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0") // or `.upToNextMajor
    )
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "MyTarget",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "SwiftyGROQ", package: "SwiftyGROQ")
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

### Supported platforms

This library supports the following platform versions:  
- iOS 11.0
- macOS 10.13
- tvOS 11.0
- watchOS 4.0

## Usage

You can make a query with the `GROQuery` object and get the GROQ query string by accessing it‚Äôs `query` property:
```swift
let groq = GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}

let query = groq.query // *[_type == "movie"]
performDatabase(query: query)
```

## Documentation
Queries can be constructed using a declarative syntax inspired by SwiftUI. 

The documentation reference for GROQ can be found [here](https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq-reference).

### Get entire database
```swift
// *
GROQuery()
```

### Special keys

Some queries require you to reference special keys when for instance querying the type or id of a document. Special keys can be accessed from the `SpecialGROQKey` enum:

```swift
// *[_id == "abc.123"]
GROQuery {
  Equal(SpecialGROQKey.id, "abc.123")
}
```

As querying for a particular document type is so common, a special structure, `Type` exists for that purpose:

```swift
// *[_type == "movie"]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}

// Is equivalent to
GROQuery {
  Equal(SpecialGROQKey.type, "movie")
}

// Which is the same as 
GROQuery {
  Equal("_type", "movie")
}
```

### Filter comparison operators
Every comparison operator comes with a structure you can use, in addition to using the operator itself. For instance with the equals operator:

```swift
// *[releaseDate == 2018]
GROQuery {
  Equal("releaseDate", 2018)
}

// Can also be written as
GROQuery {
  releaseDate == 2018
}
```

Here is a list of all comparison operators and their corresponding structures:

| Structure            | Operator  |
|----------------------|-----------|
| `Not`                | `!`       |
| `Equal`              | `==`      |
| `NotEqual`           | `!=`      |
| `LessThan`           | `<`       |
| `GreaterThan`        | `>`       |
| `LessThanOrEqual`    | `<=`      |
| `GreaterThanOrEqual` | `>=`      |
| `In`                 | `in`      |
| `And`                | `&&`      |
| `Or`                 | `\|\|`      |
| `Match`              | `match`   |

Examples: 
```swift
// *[_type in ["movie", "person"]]
GROQuery {
  In(SpecialGROQKey.type, ["movie", "person"]) // Find all movies and people
}

// *[_type == "movie" && popularity > 15 || releaseDate > "2016-04-25"]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie") // && is assumed if no operator is specified
  GreaterThan("popularity", 15)
  || GreaterThan("releaseDate", "2016-04-25")
}

// *[popularity <= 15]
GROQuery {
  LessThanOrEqual("popularity", 15)
}

// *[!(releaseDate == "2016-04-27")]
GROQuery {
  Not(
    Equal("releaseDate", "2016-04-27")
  )
}

// *[title match "wo*"]
GROQuery {
  Match("title", "wo*")
}
```

### Slicing / Pagination

Slicing can be done by using the `Slice` structure or by applying a subscript to your `GROQuery`. Fetching documents by exclusive and inclusive ranges, as well as by a single index is supported.

Examples: 
```swift
// *[_type == "movie"][0...10]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}[0..<10]

// *[_type == "movie"][0..10]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
  Slice(0...10)
}

// *[_type == "movie"][1]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}[1]
```

### Ordering
Sorting the result of the query is a common task and can be done using the `.order` modifier function, or using the `Order` structure.

```swift 
// *[_type == "movie"] | order(_createdAt asc)
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}.order(byField: SpecialGROQKey.createdAt, direction: .ascending)

// *[_type == "movie"] | order(_createdAt desc)
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
  Order("_createdAt", .descending)
}

// *[_type == "movie"] | order(releaseDate desc) | order(_createdAt asc)[0...10]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
}[0..<10]
  .order(byField: "releaseDate", direction: .descending)
  .order(byField: "_createdAt", direction: .ascending)

```

### Projection

You can choose which keys to include in your response by specifying in the `fields` block. Fields can be renamed, and new fields can be made by invoking functions.

```swift
/// *[_type == "movie"] { name, rating, releaseDate }[0...10]
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
  Slice(0..<10)
} fields: {
  "name"
  "rating"
  "releaseDate"
}

// *[_type == "movie"] { "renamedId": _id, _type, title }
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
} fields: {
  Field(renamedTo: "renamedId", SpecialGROQKey.id) // Rename field `_id` to `renamedId`
  SpecialGROQKey.type
  "title"
}

// *[_type == "movie"] { "actorCount": count(actors) }
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
} fields: {
  All()
  Count(newFieldName: "actorCount", "actors") // Make a new field, `actorCount`, storing count of array `actors`
}

// *[_type == "movie"] { ..., "rating": coalesce(rating, "unknown") }
GROQuery {
  Type("movie")
} fields: {
  All()
  Coalesce(newFieldName: "rating", "rating", fallbackValue: "unknown") // Provide fallback value if field is unset
}
```

### Data Types
You can use native Swift data types like `String`, `Int`, and `Date` when constructing queries. Here is a list of all available data types structures and their corresponding GROQ data type:

| Swift data type           | GROQ data type   | Notes                                        |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Bool`                    | `Boolean`        | --                                           |
| `Float`, `Double`         | `Float`          | Infinity and NaN are coerced to `null`       |
| `Int`                     | `Integer`        | --                                           |
| `NSNull`, `Optional.none` | `Null`           | Unknown / no value                           |
| `String`                  | `String`         | --                                           |
| `Array`                   | `Array`          | Only other GROQ-compatible types are allowed |
| `Dictionary`              | `Object`         | Only other GROQ-compatible types are allowed |
| `Pair`                    | `Pair`           | You may pass a tuple to Pair                 |
| `(Closed)Range`, `NSRange`| `Range`          | --                                           |
| `Date`                    | `Datetime`       | Produces an ISO 8601 string                  |
| `Path`                    | `Path`           | --                                           |

### Functions
Here is a list of all available function structures and their corresponding GROQ functions:

| Structure            | Function   |
|----------------------|------------|
| `Order`              | `\| order`  |
| `Count`              | `count`    |
| `Coalesce`           | `coalesce` |
| `Lower`*             | `lower`    |

\* `Lower` is only usable for keys at the moment.

## Roadmap

The most important aspects of building queries can already be used id SwiftyGROQ, but some parts have yet to be implemented. 
As an emergency fix, you can use `Custom` to write pure GROQ as a string:
```swift
// *[@["1"]]
GROQuery() {
  Custom("@[\"1\"]")
}
```
